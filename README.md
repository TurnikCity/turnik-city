# Turnik City

The weather is nice, the mood is there, so you may be wondering: is there a CalisthenicsPark (Turnik) near to me, where I can work out? The answer is most likely yes.

TurnikCity is a simple app to find a calisthenics park near you.
We want to be the largest playgrounds map in the world.
